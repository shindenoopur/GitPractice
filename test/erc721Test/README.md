`ERC721 is a standard for NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), non-fungible means they cannot be exchanged. NFTs can represent ownership over digital or physical assets. NFTs are distinguishable. Every NFT is identified by a unique uint256 ID inside the ERC-721 smart contract.`

`Basically, since ownership of ERC721â€™s is based on the ownership of a unique index or id, the fundamentals of token creation and transfer need to be extrapolated to accommodate that case.`
